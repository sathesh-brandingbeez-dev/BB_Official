Redefining Teamwork: The Social Land + Our Team Partnership
When Joe, George, Sophie, and Sarika at Social Land wanted to scale up, deliver more projects, and boost creativity all without losing the personal feel of their agency—they turned to our Dedicated Resource Model.
What began as an experiment quickly evolved into a modern blueprint for cross-border collaboration, one that feels like one team, one office, even from afar.


Everyday Team Culture
Always Together, Virtually:
Persistent video rooms on Discord connect Social Land’s leadership and account managers Sophie and Sarika with our designers, developers, marketers, and project manager. Instant interaction is the norm, not the exception.
True Partnership:
Sophie and Sarika work directly with our creative and technical talent—pooling expertise on every brief, reviewing early concepts, and ensuring client feedback is rapidly actioned.
