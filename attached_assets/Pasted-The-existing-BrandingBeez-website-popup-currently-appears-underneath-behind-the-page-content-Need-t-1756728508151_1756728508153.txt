The existing BrandingBeez website popup currently appears underneath/behind the page content. Need to modify the CSS and positioning to ensure the popup appears on top of all content at the start of the page across all devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).
Current Popup Design
Based on the existing popup, it includes:

Orange star icon at the top
"Welcome to BrandingBeez" heading
Subtitle: "Your white-label growth engine trusted by agencies worldwide"
Two statistics boxes: "25+ Agencies Trust Us" and "3x Growth Average Client"
Three bullet points about services
Orange "Get Started" button with arrow
"Maybe later" text link
Close (X) button in top-right corner
Three dots pagination indicator at bottom

Required Modifications
CSS Z-Index and Positioning Fixes
css/* Ensure popup appears on top of all content */
.popup-overlay {
    position: fixed !important;
    top: 0 !important;
    left: 0 !important;
    width: 100vw !important;
    height: 100vh !important;
    background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5) !important;
    z-index: 9999 !important;
    display: flex !important;
    justify-content: center !important;
    align-items: flex-start !important; /* Position at start/top */
    padding-top: 20px !important; /* Some margin from very top */
}

.popup-modal {
    position: relative !important;
    z-index: 10000 !important;
    max-height: 90vh !important;
    overflow-y: auto !important;
}
HTML Structure Requirements

Ensure popup container is placed directly after <body> tag
Remove any parent containers that might be limiting z-index
Add proper modal overlay structure

JavaScript Modifications

Trigger popup immediately on page load
Prevent body scroll when popup is open
Ensure popup shows across all devices (not just mobile)
Add proper event listeners for close functionality

Specific Tasks
1. CSS Updates Needed

Increase z-index values to 9999+ for overlay and 10000+ for modal
Change position to fixed instead of absolute
Set overlay to cover full viewport (100vw, 100vh)
Position modal at top of viewport with proper spacing
Ensure responsive design works on all screen sizes

2. HTML Structure Fix

Move popup HTML to be direct child of body
Ensure no parent elements are constraining the popup
Maintain existing popup content and styling

3. JavaScript Enhancements
javascript// Show popup on page load for all devices
window.addEventListener('load', function() {
    showPopup();
    document.body.style.overflow = 'hidden'; // Prevent background scroll
});

// Close popup functionality
function closePopup() {
    document.getElementById('popup-overlay').style.display = 'none';
    document.body.style.overflow = 'auto'; // Restore scroll
}
4. Cross-Device Compatibility

Test on desktop (1920px+, 1366px, 1024px)
Test on tablet (768px, iPad sizes)
Test on mobile (375px, 320px)
Ensure popup is readable and functional on all sizes

5. Preserve Existing Design

Keep the exact same visual design and content
Maintain orange color scheme (#FF8C00 or similar)
Keep all text, buttons, and interactive elements
Preserve the clean, professional appearance

Expected Result
The popup should:

Appear immediately when any user visits the website
Display on top of all page content with proper overlay
Be positioned at the top/start of the viewport
Work consistently across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
Maintain the existing BrandingBeez branding and content
Have smooth open/close animations
Prevent background scrolling when open

Files to Modify

index.html - Move popup HTML structure
style.css - Update z-index and positioning
