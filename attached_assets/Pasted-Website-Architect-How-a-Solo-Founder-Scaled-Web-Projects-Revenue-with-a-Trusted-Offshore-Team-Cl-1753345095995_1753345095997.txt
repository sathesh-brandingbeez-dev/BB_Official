Website Architect — How a Solo Founder Scaled Web Projects & Revenue with a Trusted Offshore Team
Client Profile
Company Name: Website Architect
 Industry: Web Development
 Website: https://website-architect.co.uk/
 Headquarters: United Kingdom
 Founder: Gemma
Business Model: Website Architect specializes in delivering custom WordPress websites for UK clients. As a solo entrepreneur, Gemma wore all the hats—sales, development, delivery, and support.
The Challenge
When we first met Gemma through BNI, she was running Website Architect completely on her own. She managed everything from closing deals to building websites to handling aftercare and client communication.
This all-in-one approach began to limit her growth:
Key Pain Points:
Overloaded and stretched thin


No time to focus on sales or business development


Slow delivery cycles due to solo workload


Inability to scale up or offer additional services


"Before meeting Raje and her team, I was doing the sales, building the websites and handling all the tech and aftercare."
 — Gemma, Founder, Website Architect
The Solution: From Project Help to a Dedicated Team
Initially, Gemma engaged us for project-based support. But our fast turnarounds and quality results created a domino effect. She began getting more orders and saw the potential to grow.
She quickly shifted to a dedicated resource model, where we became her extended web delivery and marketing team.

Client’s Voice: What Gemma Says
"Branding Beez have been a great help to my business. Before meeting Raje and her team, I was doing the sales, building the websites and handling all the tech and aftercare. Now I have the time to grow the business, working 'ON' it, instead of constantly 'IN' it. So they've been a gamechanger for me and my business. Even taking my first holiday this year WITHOUT my laptop! Thanks so much!"
 — Gemma, Founder, Website Architect
